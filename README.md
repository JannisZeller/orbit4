# orbit4
A little C++ based and python plotted program which is dedicated to simulate some (non relativistic, sorry Albert) orbits with some moderately verbose numerics. It is called orbit4 because of some prehistoric versions in my local dirs before I decided to set up a repo.
Still in dev and currently not simulating anything. There is still a lot to be done.

The branch `acceleration_as_static` is depreciated for now.
